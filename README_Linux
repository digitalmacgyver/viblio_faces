This has all the code except for boost and opencv. Please download boost and opencv directly from Ubuntu. No point compiling it.

sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

The paths for libraries etc will be in the right place.

Then from the directory where face is installed, type "make".

It will go into a bunch of directories and create directories. Finally it goes and creates the final executable "viblio_video_analyzer" in "src/apps/viblio_video_analyzer".
